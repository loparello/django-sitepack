# Django sitepack
A bundle of Django apps and front-end tools to develop websites with Wagtail CMS. 

## About
The idea comes from the necessety to have a proper Wagtail setup in place when starting a new project, expanded with frequently used apps - like blog - and with support for Webpack and front-end tools like Sass or JavaScript frameworks. This prevents from having to install CMS, apps and Webpack with all the required configuration from scratch every time, and let you develop your Django templates with more than just vanilla CSS and JavaScript.

The bundle comes in fact with handy front-end development tools and commodities like SASS and Vue.js, already configured with Webpack and integrated with Django static files and templates system using [django-webpack-loader](https://github.com/owais/django-webpack-loader). 
These tools can be changed at convenience just by installing and removing packages with npm and updating the webpack.config.js file accordingly.
